 - Which statement about the active site of an enzyme is correct? (A) It always has a specific fixed shape. (B) It reduces the total energy of the product. (C) It does not form chemical bonds with its substrate. (D) It is determined by the primary structure of the enzyme.****D!!!!
 - When investigating the rate of reaction of the enzyme lipase on the hydrolysis of triglycerides, the pH must be maintained at an optimum to prevent the lipase denaturing. What is the reason for this? (A) The addition of water molecules produced by hydrolysis increases the pH. (B) The products of hydrolysis decrease the pH. (C) The products of hydrolysis increase the pH. (D) The removal of water molecules used in hydrolysis decreases the pH.****B!!!!
 - Equal sized potato pieces were placed into a test-tube and covered with a sucrose solution. The test tube was left for 30 minutes. All other variables were controlled. After 30 minutes, the potato piece had not changed in size. What can be concluded from this result? (A) The concentration of sucrose is the same in the potato and in the solution and there is no more movement of water into or out of the potato. (B) The concentration of sucrose is the same in the potato and in the solution and there is no net movement of water into the potato. (C) The water potential is the same in the potato and in the sucrose solution and there is no more movement of water into or out of the potato. (D) The water potential is the same in the potato and in the sucrose solution and there is no net movement of water into or out of the potato.****D!!!!
 - What is a definition of transpiration? (A) the evaporation of water vapour from a leaf due to the diffusion of water from an area of low water potential to high water potential (B) the loss of water vapour from a plant to its environment by diffusion down a water potential gradient (C) the movement of water from root to leaf due to the adhesion of water molecules to one another (D) the uptake of water by plant roots by movement of water down a continuous water potential gradient from air to soil.****B!!!!
 - Which statement is correct? (A) Alveoli have goblet cells to produce mucus to trap pathogens from the air. (B) Cartilage in the bronchi keeps the bronchi open and allows air to flow through freely. (C) Complete rings of cartilage in the bronchioles make sure that air can reach the alveoli. (D) During exercise, muscles in the bronchioles and alveoli relax to allow a greater flow of air.****B!!!!
 - Different antibiotics function in different ways. It is important that the antibiotic kills the bacteria, but does not harm the infected human. The antibiotic tetracycline has been found to affect the way in which human mitochondria function. Which statements could explain why human mitochondria function is affected by tetracycline? (A) The antibiotic prevents the synthesis of peptidoglycan cell walls. (B) The antibiotic prevents synthesis of linear DNA. (C) The antibiotic prevents translation of circular DNA. (D) The antibiotic prevents translation by binding to 70S ribosomes.****D!!!!
 - Ribosomes exist as separate subunits that are bound together during protein synthesis. What do these subunits consist of? (A) mRNA and protein (B) mRNA and tRNA (C) rRNA and protein (D) rRNA and tRNA.****C!!!!
 - Which feature of glycogen distinguishes glycogen from starch? (A) All glycogen molecules are highly branched. (B) All glycogen molecules are polysaccharides. (C) All glycogen molecules contain Î±-glucose. (D) All glycogen molecules contain 1,4-glycosidic bonds.****A!!!!
 - During mitosis in animal cells, which process occurs after prophase? (A) Centrioles move towards the poles of the cell. (B) Centromeres attach to spindle microtubules. (C) Chromatids join to form chromosomes. (D) Chromosomes condense and become visible.****B!!!!
 - A length of DNA was analysed and sequenced. 24% of its nitrogenous bases were adenine. Which percentage of the bases will be cytosine? (A) 24 (B) 26 (C) 48 (D) 76.****B!!!!
